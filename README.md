# Getting Started

```javascript
// Before anything else, run:
npm install
```

```javascript
// Then run the tests:
npm start
```

```javascript
// This runs the starter tests with a hot-reloading dev server (listens for changes and automatically reruns)
npm run dev
```

```javascript
// runs betterIndex.js which imports all my completed functions with passing results (hopefully)
npm run start:better
```

```javascript
// runs betterIndex.js with a hot-reloading dev server 
npm run dev:better
```
